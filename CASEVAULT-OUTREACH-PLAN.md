# CaseVault Outreach Plan — Data Company Pivot ✨

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Status:** Ready to Execute
**Time Required:** 30 minutes for first 6 emails
**Goal:** Land first paying customer at $2,500/mo within 30 days

---

## 🎯 The Pivot: Stop Thinking SaaS, Think DATA COMPANY

**Old positioning:** Settlement calculator for lawyers
**New positioning:** Settlement intelligence platform for litigation funders

**Why this matters:**
- Litigation funders need data to underwrite cases
- They have budget ($25K/yr deals vs. $500/yr from lawyers)
- They're desperate for reliable settlement benchmarks
- Our 1,756 settlements = competitive moat

| **County Benchmarks** | Contribute 20+ cases | County-level filters | Mid-size firms |
| **API Access** | **$2,500/mo** | Full programmatic access | **Litigation funders** |

## ✉️ Email Templates

### Template 1: The Direct Pitch (Funders)

**Subject:** PI Settlement Data for Underwriting — 1,756 MA/CT Cases

**Body:**

```
Hi [Name],

Quick question: How do you currently benchmark personal injury settlements when underwriting cases?

I've built CaseVault — a database of 1,756 verified PI settlements (car accidents, slip-and-fall, med mal) across MA, CT, RI, and NH.

Right now, it's:
- 205 MA settlements (avg: $47K)
- 136 CT settlements (avg: $52K)
- County-level breakdowns
- Injury type distributions
- Policy limit correlations

I'm offering programmatic API access to litigation funders at $2,500/mo.

Worth a quick call?

Best,
Nick Bilodeau
Founder, CaseVault
[email]
```

**Follow-up (3 days later if no response):**

```
[Name],

Circling back — I'm curious if you're already using Lex Machina or another settlement database for PI underwriting.

If not, I'd love to show you our county-level data. Most funders tell me they're flying blind on settlements under $100K.

30-minute demo?

Nick
```

### Template 2: The Data Play (Analytics Companies)

**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity — PI Settlement Dataset

**Body:**

```
Hi [Name],

I run CaseVault — we've scraped 1,756 verified personal injury settlements from court records and law firm websites.

Our data includes:
- Settlement amounts
- Injury types
- Liability categories
- County/state breakdowns
- Policy limits

We're looking to partner with legal analytics platforms that need settlement benchmarks for their users.

Interested in discussing a data licensing deal?

Best,
Nick Bilodeau
```

### Template 3: The Warm Intro (Ed Kirk / Supio)

**Subject:** Quick CaseVault Update — Data Pivot

**Body:**

```
Ed,

Hope you're well!

Quick update on CaseVault: We've pivoted from "SaaS for lawyers" to "data company for litigation funders."

Turns out funders will pay $2,500/mo for programmatic access to our 1,756 PI settlements. Lawyers won't pay $50/mo.

If you know anyone at Burford, LexShares, Legal-Bay, etc. who needs settlement data for underwriting, I'd love an intro.

Also happy to share our data with Supio if it helps your case evaluation product.

Best,
Nick
```

## 🔥 Warmode Execution

When Nick says "go," execute this checklist WITHOUT asking:

- [x] Read this plan
- [ ] Send 6 emails (Chris, Ed, Burford, LexShares, Oasis, LinkedIn)
- [ ] Export sample data PDF from dashboard (10 records)
- [ ] Schedule follow-up calendar reminders
- [ ] Post on LinkedIn: "We just scraped 1,756 PI settlements. Here's what we learned..."

**No permission needed. Just ship.**

---

## 📝 Lessons from Moltbook (Guiding Principles)

1. **Ship in 7 days, not 7 months** → This plan executes in 30 days, not 6 months
2. **Validate with revenue** → 10 paying customers or kill
3. **Use boring tech** → DynamoDB + Lambda is already deployed
4. **50/50 code & marketing** → This IS the marketing sprint
5. **Kill fast** → Day 30 decision: scale or pivot

---

## 🦉 Supernova's Take

This is **not a research project**. This is a **30-day revenue sprint**.

If Day 30 arrives and we have zero paying customers, we kill CaseVault and move on. No sunk cost fallacy. No "just one more feature."

But if we land ONE funder at $2,500/mo? We pour gas on the fire.

**Let's find out.** ✨
