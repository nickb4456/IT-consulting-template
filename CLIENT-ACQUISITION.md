## 💰 Medium-Term (This Month)

### 5. Partner with Complementary Services
- **Accountants** → Refer tech clients to you, you refer accounting to them
- **Commercial real estate agents** → New businesses need IT setup
- **Office furniture/supplies** → Same new business market
- **Web designers** → They design, you build/host/maintain

### 6. Productized Services (Fixed Price, Clear Scope)
Create packages that are easy to buy:

| Package | Price | Includes |
|---------|-------|----------|

| **AI Setup** | $499 | ChatGPT integration for customer service |
