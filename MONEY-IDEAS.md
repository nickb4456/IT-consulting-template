## 🚀 Passive Income Plays

### 1. Micro-SaaS Tools (One-Time Build → Recurring Revenue)
**Tools I can build that sell themselves:**

| Tool | Price | Target | I Build, You Sell |
|------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| **Invoice Generator** | $5/mo | Freelancers | Already have one in projects |
| **Contract Generator** | $9/mo | Small biz | Already have one |
| **Meeting Cost Calculator** | $3/mo | Managers | Simple, viral potential |
| **SEO Audit Tool** | $15/mo | Agencies | DevScope upgraded |
| **Testimonial Widget** | $10/mo | Any business | Already have one |

**Play:** Bundle 3-5 tools as "Small Business Toolkit" for $29/mo

### 2. Template Marketplaces
**One-time effort, perpetual sales:**

- **Notion templates** → Sell on Gumroad/Notion marketplace
- **n8n workflow templates** → You have 11+ already
- **Landing page templates** → Dozens in projects folder
- **Legal document templates** → DraftBridge clause library

**Play:** Package existing projects as templates, list on Gumroad

### 3. Affiliate/Referral Plays
**Recommend tools, get paid:**

- Become a **Clio** (legal software) affiliate → ~20% recurring
- **QuickBooks** ProAdvisor → Referral bonuses
- **Webflow/Squarespace** partner → Build sites, earn affiliate
- **Hosting referrals** (Cloudflare, Vercel, etc.)

## 🎯 Service Productization

### 4. "Website Rescue" Package
**Fixed price, clear scope:**

> "Your website is broken. For $497, we'll fix it in 48 hours."
> - Performance optimization
> - Mobile fixes
> - SSL setup
> - Basic SEO

**I can:** Build the audit, generate the report, scope the work
**You do:** Close the deal, maybe some manual fixes

### 5. "AI Setup" Package
**Everyone wants AI, nobody knows how:**

> "$299 - We'll set up ChatGPT/Claude for your business"
> - Custom GPT for your FAQ
> - Email response templates
> - Document summarization workflow

**I can:** Build the GPT, set up the workflows
**You do:** 30-min call to customize

### 6. Retainer Clients
**Monthly recurring = stability:**

> "$299/mo - 5 hours of tech support + priority response"

Get 10 retainer clients = $3k/mo baseline before any projects

## 🎪 Creative/Viral Plays

### 7. Free Tool → Upsell
**Give away value, capture leads:**

| Free Tool | Upsell |
|-----------|--------|
| Website audit | "Fix these issues" service |
| Contract generator | Premium templates |
| SEO checker | Monthly SEO service |
| Invoice generator | Bookkeeping referral |

### 8. Local Business "Gotcha" Campaign
**Aggressive but effective:**

1. I audit 100 local business websites
2. Find ones with embarrassing issues (no HTTPS, broken mobile)
3. Send personalized email: "Your competitor [name] has a faster site than you"
4. Offer to fix for $X

**I can:** Run the audits, draft the emails
**You do:** Send and close

### 9. "Before Your Competitor Does" Positioning
**Fear sells:**

> "While you're reading this, your competitor is getting the AI upgrade you're putting off."

Use this angle in all marketing.

### 10. Productized AI Builds
**Specific outcomes, fixed prices:**

| Product | Price | Deliverable |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| AI Receptionist | $499 | Chatbot for website |
| Document Processor | $799 | PDF → structured data |
| Email Responder | $399 | Auto-draft replies |
| Lead Qualifier | $599 | Form → scored leads |

## 🔄 Recurring Revenue Ideas

### 11. Maintenance Plans
Every website you build → $50-100/mo maintenance plan
- Hosting
- Updates
- Monthly backup
- 1 hour of changes

### 12. "Tech Partner" for Small Biz
Position as fractional CTO:
> "$500/mo - I'm your tech department"
> - Answer any tech question
> - Vendor evaluation
> - Security monitoring
> - Monthly tech review call

### 13. White-Label for Agencies
Other agencies need dev work:
> "I build, you sell, we both win"
> - They mark up 50-100%
> - You get steady work
> - No client management
