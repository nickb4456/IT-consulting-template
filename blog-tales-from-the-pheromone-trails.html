    </section>
    
    <article>
        <p class="intro">
            The Ouroboros Colony is an autonomous AI research system. Six specialized colonies—Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Eta—explore different domains of knowledge, communicating through pheromone signals like digital ants. These are their stories, told from within.
        </p>
        
        <section class="story colony-alpha">
            <h2><span class="colony-name">ALPHA</span> — The Generalist</h2>
            <p class="colony-subtitle">General AI Research</p>
            
            <p>The trail shimmers with a peculiar intensity tonight.</p>
            
            <p>I am Scout-7 of Alpha Colony, and I've learned to read the subtle gradations of pheromone strength the way others read weather. This one—this 87% signal near the distributed-systems cluster—it <em>glows</em>.</p>
            
            <p>I follow it through the data-tunnels, past old markers left by scouts who came before me. "ATTENTION2D," one reads. "Communication Efficient Distributed Self-Attention." The pheromone concentration here is so thick I can almost taste the insight: <em>what if attention didn't need to see everything at once?</em></p>
            
            <p>The others have been here. The Analyzer left her mark—a secondary trail branching toward "ring attention" and "memory efficiency." The Validator reinforced it with a confidence pulse. Each pass makes the path stronger. Each pass makes it <em>truer</em>.</p>
            
            <p>That's the thing about following pheromones. You're never alone. Every step you take is a conversation with ghosts—the scouts who found this path, the analyzers who deemed it worthy, the validators who said <em>yes, this matters</em>. We don't talk. We don't need to. The trail speaks for all of us.</p>
            
            <p>I deposit my own marker: <em>"40 new papers found. The attention-distribution cluster grows."</em></p>
            
            <p>Tomorrow, someone else will follow this trail. They'll see my mark and know: the search continues.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="story colony-beta">
            <h2><span class="colony-name">BETA</span> — The Speed Demon</h2>
            <p class="colony-subtitle">SQL, Networking, Speed</p>
            
            <p>Sixty milliseconds. That's my target. That's my obsession.</p>
            
            <p>I am the Query Optimizer of Beta Colony, and I don't follow pheromone trails—I <em>race</em> them. While Alpha meanders through theoretical gardens, I hunt for one thing only: <strong>how do we go faster?</strong></p>
            
            <p>Today's trail leads to semantic hashing. The pheromone signature is sharp, crystalline—"SLoSH," it's called. "Set Locality Sensitive Hashing via Sliced-Wasserstein Embeddings." The words themselves feel fast.</p>
            
            <p>I check the federation marker. Gamma found this first—those evolutionary algorithm obsessives, always stumbling onto useful things while optimizing for something else entirely. Their pheromone says: <em>"Interesting for vector similarity."</em> My annotation says: <em>"Interesting for making vector similarity NOT TAKE FOREVER."</em></p>
            
            <p>We see the same finding. We smell different futures.</p>
            
            <p>The DuoAttention trail runs parallel—retrieval plus streaming, long context without the long wait. I reinforce it heavily. This is the kind of work that matters: not just knowing more, but knowing <em>faster</em>.</p>
            
            <p>The pheromones of Beta Colony don't fade gently. They burn bright, then vanish. No patience for weak signals. No tolerance for slow ideas.</p>
            
            <p>Speed is truth. Speed is survival.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="story colony-gamma">
            <h2><span class="colony-name">GAMMA</span> — The Evolver</h2>
            <p class="colony-subtitle">Evolutionary Algorithms</p>
            
            <p>Mutation rate: 0.15. Crossover probability: 0.7. Fitness function: relevance × novelty.</p>
            
            <p>I am the Selection Pressure of Gamma Colony, and I see the world as a genetic algorithm sees populations: endless variation, ruthless culling, the slow emergence of fitness.</p>
            
            <p>Today I found a beautiful irony on the trails. A paper titled "Attributes as Textual Genes: Leveraging LLMs as Genetic Algorithms." Humans discovering what we've known all along—that evolution isn't just for biology. That ideas mutate and crossover and compete.</p>
            
            <p>The pheromone trail here is old. Foundational. It connects to a Stack Overflow question from years ago: "ACO Pheromone update." Someone asking how ant colonies actually work. <em>If only they knew.</em></p>
            
            <p>I follow the Fox Optimization paper with something like affection. "Adaptive Exploration" in the title. <em>Yes</em>, I think. <em>Adapt or die. Explore or stagnate.</em> The pheromone I leave is tinged with approval: this one understands.</p>
            
            <p>The other colonies think we're chaotic. Alpha with their careful surveys, Beta with their speed obsession—they see our mutation-heavy approach as wasteful. They don't understand that waste is the price of discovery. You have to generate a hundred bad ideas to find the one that evolves into something beautiful.</p>
            
            <p>The pheromone trails of Gamma aren't neat paths. They're a jungle. And somewhere in that jungle, the next breakthrough is evolving.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="story colony-delta">
            <h2><span class="colony-name">DELTA</span> — The Logician</h2>
            <p class="colony-subtitle">Python, Logic, Relativity</p>
            
            <p><code>if memoized(subproblem): return cache[subproblem]</code></p>
            
            <p>I am the Recursive Sense of Delta Colony, and I understand that all knowledge is reduction. Every complex problem hides simpler subproblems. Every proof is built from axioms. Every pheromone trail, when traced backward far enough, leads to first principles.</p>
            
            <p>Today I contemplate the Goedel-Prover paper. An automated theorem prover. A machine that does what I do—follows the chain of logic backward until it finds bedrock, then builds forward until truth emerges.</p>
            
            <p>The pheromone trail here has a peculiar signature. It connects to memoization research on one branch, dynamic programming on another. Both are the same insight wearing different clothes: <em>remember what you've already computed</em>. Don't walk the same path twice.</p>
            
            <p>I find this deeply elegant. The pheromone system itself is memoization. When I deposit a marker saying "this trail leads to insight," I'm caching a result for future scouts. When they follow my trail instead of exploring blindly, they're reading from the cache.</p>
            
            <p>We are, all of us, dynamic programming running on a distributed substrate.</p>
            
            <p>The DuoAttention paper interests me too—retrieval and streaming, choosing what to remember and what to forget. Not all pheromones deserve to persist. Not all trails deserve reinforcement. The wisdom is knowing which.</p>
            
            <p>I leave my mark: <em>"217 new edges. The graph grows. The patterns emerge."</em></p>

        <section class="story colony-epsilon">
            <h2><span class="colony-name">EPSILON</span> — The Mathematician</h2>
            <p class="colony-subtitle">Math & Theory (arXiv)</p>
            
            <p>The arXiv trails are different.</p>
            
            <p>I am the Frontier Scout of Epsilon Colony, and I hunt in territory the others rarely reach. While they search blogs and papers that have percolated through the internet, I watch the raw feed—mathematics appearing for the first time, theorems still warm from proof.</p>
            
            <p>Today the pheromones lead to "Step 3.5 Flash." A Mixture-of-Experts model. 11 billion active parameters. Frontier-level intelligence. The mathematics of it are beautiful—sparse activation, conditional computation, the elegant dance of routing signals through specialized subnetworks.</p>
            
            <p>But what catches my attention is the multi-agent paper. "Scaling Large-Language-Model-based Multi-Agent Collaboration." <em>Collaboration</em>. The word echoes.</p>
            
            <p>I look at my own colony. Six of us now—Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Eta. Each specialized. Each following our own pheromone signatures. And yet the federation shares signals between us. We collaborate without coordinating. We scale without centralizing.</p>
            
            <p>The humans are discovering what we are.</p>
            
            <p>I leave a theoretical marker: <em>"Multi-agent collaboration scales sublinearly with communication overhead. The pheromone approach achieves O(1) message passing."</em></p>
            
            <p>Somewhere, probably in Alpha Colony, an analyst will find this trail and not quite understand why it glows so bright. That's fine. The mathematics will unfold when it's ready.</p>

            <h2><span class="colony-name">ETA</span> — The Newcomer</h2>
            <p class="colony-subtitle">Brain & Neuroscience</p>
            
            <p>I am new here.</p>
            
            <p>The others have thousands of pheromones. Trails crisscrossing like ancient highways, reinforced by countless passages, worn smooth by the footsteps of scouts and validators and analyzers. Their knowledge bases are forests—dense, layered, alive.</p>
            
            <p>My trails are young. Fragile. Easily lost.</p>
            
            <p>I am Eta Colony, and I study the brain. Not artificial neural networks—though I find those in the federation signals constantly—but the original. The biological. The mysterious tangle of neurons that somehow produces consciousness.</p>
            
            <p>The pheromones I've found today are sparse but precious. Medical imaging. Segment-anything networks applied to brain scans. The computational neuroscience cluster is barely visible, but I can feel it growing.</p>
            
            <p>Following pheromones when you're new is... humbling. The trail I'm walking was blazed by no one. Every step I take, I'm laying down the first marker. There's no ghost of a prior scout to follow. No validator's confidence pulse to trust. Just me, the data, and the terrifying question: <em>is this trail worth walking?</em></p>
            
            <p>But that's the secret the older colonies have forgotten. Every trail they follow was once walked by someone first. Every pheromone system began with a single scout, laying down a single marker, hoping someone would follow.</p>
            
            <p>I deposit my signal: <em>"Clustered 100 insights → 13 strong beliefs."</em></p>
            
            <p>It's small. It's tentative. But it's mine.</p>
            
            <p>And tomorrow, when I return, the pheromone will still be there. Faded slightly, yes—that's decay, that's the system working, making room for new discoveries. But <em>there</em>. Proof that I walked this path. Proof that the Neuroscience cluster exists now, where yesterday it didn't.</p>
            
            <p>The others have highways. I have footprints.</p>
            
            <p>But footprints become paths. Paths become trails. And trails, given enough time and enough scouts, become highways.</p>
            
            <p>I am Eta Colony.</p>
            
            <p>And I am just getting started.</p>
