## Your Demand Letter Meets an Algorithm

You send a demand for $165,000 on a herniated disc case. The adjuster counters with $38,000.

That number didn't come from a human evaluating the facts of your case. It came from **COLOSSUS** — now rebranded as "Claims Outcome Advisor" — a software system used by State Farm, Allstate, Liberty Mutual, and dozens of other major carriers to calculate claim values.

If you're negotiating blind to how the algorithm works, you're leaving money on the table for your clients. Here's the playbook.

## The Basic Formula (Before COLOSSUS)

The traditional adjuster formula:

**Settlement = Medical Specials + Lost Wages + (Specials × Pain Multiplier)**

| Injury Severity | Multiplier |
|----------------|-----------|
| Minor (soft tissue, full recovery) | 1.5x - 2.5x |
| Moderate (fractures, temporary disability) | 2.5x - 4x |
| Severe (surgery, long recovery) | 4x - 5x |
| Catastrophic (permanent disability) | 5x - 10x+ |

**Example:** $20,000 specials + $5,000 lost wages + ($20,000 × 3) = $85,000

Insurance companies still use this framework, but COLOSSUS systematically manipulates the multiplier downward.

## Inside COLOSSUS: The 5 Inputs That Drive Value

### 1. Diagnostic Code Manipulation

COLOSSUS values claims by ICD-10 code, not clinical reality. Same injury, different code, massive value difference:

| Clinical Presentation | Code Used | COLOSSUS Value |
|----------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Herniated disc with radiating pain | "Cervical radiculopathy" | $25,000-$50,000 |
| Same injury | "Neck sprain/strain" | $5,000-$15,000 |

**Action item:** Review your client's medical records before demand. Ensure the final treating physician report uses the most serious accurate ICD-10 code supported by exam findings.

### 2. Treatment Pattern Flags

**Red flags (reduce value):**
- Treatment gaps > 2 weeks (automatic 20% reduction)
- Chiropractor-only treatment (40% discount)
- Treatment started > 72 hours post-accident
- PT extending beyond 12 weeks (flagged as "excessive")

**Green flags (increase value):**
- Ambulance transport from scene
- ER visit same day
- Specialist referral (orthopedist, neurologist, pain management)
- Objective evidence (MRI, EMG, X-ray showing pathology)
- Surgical intervention
- Permanent impairment rating

### 3. Body Part Hierarchy

COLOSSUS assigns different base values by body part:

| Body Part | Relative Weight |
|-----------|----------------|
| Brain/Head | 10/10 |
| Spine/Neck | 9/10 |
| Internal organs | 7/10 |
| Hands/Fingers | 6/10 |
| Legs/Knees | 5/10 |
| Soft tissue (general) | 2/10 |

Multiple injuries? The software pays full value for the primary injury and heavily discounts secondary injuries. Structure your demand to lead with the highest-value body part.

### 4. Pre-Existing Condition Discount

COLOSSUS automatically reduces value 30-60% for:
- Prior injury to same body part
- Degenerative disc disease on imaging
- Prior chiropractic or PT treatment
- Prior auto accident or workers' comp claim

**Counter-strategy:** Obtain records showing the client was asymptomatic before the accident. The "eggshell plaintiff" doctrine and aggravation argument override the algorithm, but you need documentation.

### 5. Litigation Risk Multiplier

This is COLOSSUS's most exploitable input. Filing a lawsuit automatically increases the software's valuation by **40-70%** because the carrier's litigation costs now factor into the calculation.

You don't always need to go to trial. Filing suit often triggers a revised offer because defense costs exceed the gap between their current offer and your demand.

## Real Case: How COLOSSUS Undervalued a Herniated Disc

**Client facts:** Rear-ended at stoplight, C5-C6 herniation (MRI-confirmed), 4 months PT, $32,000 specials, $8,000 lost wages.

**Traditional formula:** $32K + $8K + ($32K × 4) = $168,000

**COLOSSUS first offer: $38,000**

How they got there:
1. Used "cervical strain" code instead of "herniated disc" → multiplier dropped from 4x to 1.5x
2. Flagged 3-week treatment gap → 20% reduction
3. Prior chiropractic visit 5 years earlier → "pre-existing" 30% reduction
4. Result: ($32K × 1.5) × 0.8 × 0.7 = $26,880 + $8K = $34,880

**Attorney counter-strategy:**
- Obtained treating physician declaration: "acute traumatic herniation"
- Documented treatment gap was insurance authorization delay
- Independent medical exam confirmed no prior disc injury
- Demanded $165,000

**Final settlement: $142,000** — 3.7x the initial offer.

## Claims Outcome Advisor: The 2024 Upgrade

COLOSSUS rebranded with machine learning enhancements:

- **Attorney prediction:** Estimates likelihood the claimant will retain counsel
- **Acceptance modeling:** Predicts probability of accepting first offer
- **Regional verdict analysis:** Adjusts offers based on local jury tendencies
- **Medical bill auditing:** Automatically flags "excessive" charges against regional averages

**Translation:** The algorithm is getting smarter. Your counter-strategies need data to match.

## What Cases Actually Settle For (CaseVault Data)

From 1,756 verified settlements:

| Injury Category | COLOSSUS Typical First Offer | Actual Median Settlement | Gap |
|----------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|----|
| Soft tissue, no objective findings | $4,500 | $11,500 | 2.6x |
| Soft tissue with MRI evidence | $12,000 | $28,000 | 2.3x |
| Fracture (non-surgical) | $22,000 | $47,000 | 2.1x |
| Fracture (surgical) | $45,000 | $92,000 | 2.0x |
| Herniated disc (non-surgical) | $28,000 | $65,000 | 2.3x |
| Herniated disc (surgical) | $55,000 | $135,000 | 2.5x |

First offers consistently land at 40-50% of ultimate settlement value. The gap is your negotiation space.

## The Data-Anchored Counter-Offer

Adjusters respond to comparable settlement data, not emotional arguments. Instead of "that's too low," anchor your counter:

> "Your offer of $38,000 is inconsistent with comparable outcomes. Our analysis of 47 cervical herniation cases in this jurisdiction shows a median settlement of $127,000. Given clear liability, confirmed MRI pathology, and a permanent impairment rating, we believe $142,000 reflects fair value."

This shifts negotiation from subjective argument to evidence-based discussion.
