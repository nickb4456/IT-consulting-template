## The Fee Structure Decision

Every PI firm has settled on its fee model. But are you leaving money on the table — for your clients or your practice?

We analyzed fee structures across **1,756 settlements** in the CaseVault database to show what clients actually net under different models, and how case valuation data changes the economics for both sides.

## Contingency Fee: The Standard Model

### Standard Percentages

| Case Stage | Typical Fee | Client Keeps |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Pre-suit settlement | 33.33% | 66.67% |
| Post-filing settlement | 40% | 60% |
| Trial verdict | 40-45% | 55-60% |
| Appeal | 45-50% | 50-55% |

### Why Contingency Works for PI

**Aligned incentives.** You maximize when clients maximize. No conflict of interest on settlement timing.

**Access to justice.** Clients with $0 in savings can retain top counsel. Your practice self-selects for strong cases.

**Predictable economics.** Both sides know the split upfront. No billing disputes, no collections headaches.

## Hourly Billing: When It Makes Sense (Rarely)

### Typical PI Hourly Rates

| Experience | Rate |
|-----------|------|
| Junior (1-3 years) | $200-$350/hr |
| Mid-level (4-7 years) | $350-$500/hr |
| Senior (8+ years) | $500-$700/hr |
| Partner/Trial | $600-$1,000+/hr |

### The Math Problem

A $100,000 settlement looks cheaper on hourly if the case only takes 50 hours: $25,000 at $500/hr vs. $33,333 on contingency.

But real cases don't take 50 hours. A typical $100,000 case requires:
- Intake & case evaluation: 2 hours
- Medical record review: 8 hours
- Demand prep: 5 hours
- Negotiation: 12 hours
- Client communication: 8 hours
- Discovery: 15 hours
- Depositions: 12 hours
- Trial prep (if needed): 40+ hours

**Total: 100+ hours × $500 = $50,000+** — more than contingency.

Plus hourly requires a $10,000-$25,000 retainer most injury victims can't afford.

### Hourly Only Works When:

- Clear liability, quick settlement expected
- Small damages (under $50,000)
- Case resolves in < 20 hours of attorney time
- Client has cash for retainer

## Hidden Costs: What Eats Into Client Recovery

### Case Costs vs. Attorney Fees

Even on contingency, clients may owe case costs:

| Expense | Range |
|---------|-------|
| Medical records | $50-$500 |
| Court filing fees | $300-$500 |
| Deposition transcripts | $500-$1,500 each |
| Expert witnesses | $2,000-$10,000+ |
| Investigators | $1,000-$5,000 |

**Total case costs:** $5,000-$30,000 for litigated cases.

### Cost Deduction Timing Matters

**Method 1 — Costs deducted first (client-favorable):**
$100K settlement - $10K costs = $90K → 33.33% fee = $30K → **Client nets $60,000**

**Method 2 — Costs deducted after (attorney-favorable):**
$100K settlement → 33.33% fee = $33,333 → minus $10K costs → **Client nets $56,667**

$3,333 difference from one contract clause. Review your retainer agreements.

## What Clients Actually Net: CaseVault Data

### Real Fee Breakdowns

**Case 1: Soft Tissue, Quick Settlement**
- Settlement: $28,000
- Fee (33.33%): $9,333 | Costs: $1,200 | Medical liens: $7,500
- **Client nets: $10,000** (35.7% of gross)

**Case 2: Herniated Disc, Litigated**
- Settlement: $145,000
- Fee (40%): $58,000 | Costs: $12,500 | Medical liens: $32,000
- **Client nets: $42,500** (29.3% of gross)

**Case 3: TBI, Tried to Verdict**
- Verdict: $850,000
- Fee (40%): $340,000 | Costs: $48,000 | Medical liens: $180,000
- **Client nets: $282,000** (33.2% of gross)

**Key insight:** Medical liens are the silent killer of client recovery. Negotiating liens down is as valuable as negotiating the settlement up.

## Represented vs. Unrepresented: The ROI Question

From 1,756 CaseVault settlements:

| Status | Median Settlement | Median Specials | Multiplier |
|--------|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Unrepresented | $22,000 | $11,500 | 1.9x |
| Represented | $78,000 | $21,000 | 3.7x |

**Even after a 33% fee, represented clients net 2.2x more than unrepresented clients.** This is the data point that closes consultations.

### Why Attorneys Get More

1. **Data-driven demands** — anchoring with comparable settlement data instead of guessing
2. **Aggressive negotiation** — adjusters lowball unrepresented claimants by 50-70%
3. **Litigation threat** — filing suit triggers a 40-70% COLOSSUS value increase
4. **Procedural expertise** — no missed deadlines, proper documentation, lien negotiation

## Fee Negotiation: When Clients Have Leverage

### Negotiable Scenarios

**Large case value ($500K+):** Attorneys accept lower percentages because the dollar payout remains substantial.
- Suggested sliding scale: 33% on first $100K, 25% on next $400K, 20% above $500K

**Clear liability, fast settlement:** If the case resolves pre-suit in under 90 days, a 25% fee is reasonable.

**Referral cases:** If a referring attorney takes a cut (typically 33% of the fee), the originating attorney may accept a reduced client percentage.

### Questions Sophisticated Clients Ask

1. Are costs deducted before or after calculating your fee?
2. Do I owe costs if we lose?
3. Will you negotiate my medical liens?
4. What's your average settlement for injuries like mine?
5. What's your trial experience if the case doesn't settle?

## Data Changes the Fee Conversation

When attorneys can show a client exactly where their case falls in a distribution of comparable settlements, the fee conversation shifts from "trust me" to "here's the evidence."

Clients who see that 47 similar herniated disc cases settled for $65,000-$180,000 understand why professional representation is worth 33%.
