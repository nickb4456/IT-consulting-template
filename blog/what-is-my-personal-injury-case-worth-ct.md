## The Case Valuation Problem Every PI Attorney Faces

You're evaluating a new intake. The client has a herniated disc from a rear-end collision in Hartford. They want to know: "What's my case worth?"

You know the answer depends on a dozen variables. But your client wants a number — and so does opposing counsel when you send the demand.

We analyzed **136 verified Connecticut personal injury settlements** in the CaseVault database to give you defensible benchmarks for case valuation.

## Connecticut Settlement Values by Injury Type

| Injury Category | Median Settlement | Typical Range | Case Count |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|------------|
| **Soft Tissue** (sprains, strains) | $12,500 | $5,000 - $35,000 | 42 |
| **Fractures** | $47,000 | $25,000 - $125,000 | 34 |
| **Herniated Disc** | $85,000 | $45,000 - $175,000 | 28 |
| **TBI** | $185,000 | $75,000 - $500,000+ | 18 |
| **Permanent Disability** | $350,000 | $150,000 - $1,000,000+ | 14 |

These are settlement values, not verdicts. Settlements typically land at 60-75% of probable trial value, but eliminate trial risk and reduce time-to-resolution by 12-18 months.

## The 5 Multiplier Factors in Connecticut

### 1. Medical Specials as Foundation

Connecticut adjusters calculate pain and suffering as a multiplier of medical expenses. Our data shows:

- **Temporary injury, full recovery:** 1.5-3x medical bills
- **Permanent partial disability:** 3-5x medical bills
- **Permanent total disability:** 5-10x medical bills

**Practical example:** $25,000 in specials with a herniated disc → expect $75,000-$125,000 total demand range.

### 2. Modified Comparative Negligence (51% Bar)

Connecticut's Conn. Gen. Stat. § 52-584 bars recovery at 51% fault. This creates a steep value cliff:

| Client Fault | Recovery |
|-------------|----------|
| 0-25% | Strong negotiating position |
| 26-49% | Viable but discounted 40-60% |
| 50% | Minimum viable case |
| 51%+ | No recovery — decline or settle fast |

Disputed liability cases are worth 40-60% less than clear liability cases with identical injuries. Police reports assigning fault are worth $20,000-$50,000 in settlement leverage.

### 3. Permanency Documentation

A physician's permanent impairment rating doubles settlement value in our dataset. Push for a thorough impairment evaluation at MMI using AMA Guidelines.

### 4. Policy Limits as Ceiling

Connecticut minimum auto insurance is $25,000/$50,000. Average policies run $100,000/$300,000. Always investigate UIM coverage early — a $200,000 injury nets $25,000 against minimum limits without strong UIM.

### 5. Not a No-Fault State

Unlike Massachusetts, Connecticut has no PIP threshold. Any injury supports a lawsuit. This means liability battles are more common but you're not gated by a medical expense threshold.

## COLOSSUS Factors That Move CT Cases

Most Connecticut carriers use COLOSSUS (now Claims Outcome Advisor). Key inputs that move the needle:

**Value Reducers:**
- Treatment gaps > 2 weeks
- Chiropractic-only treatment (no MD involvement)
- Delayed initial treatment (> 72 hours post-accident)
- Pre-existing conditions to same body part

**Value Multipliers:**
- Ambulance transport from scene
- Specialist treatment (orthopedist, neurologist, pain management)
- MRI/objective evidence of injury
- Surgical intervention
- Permanent impairment rating

**Documentation strategy:** Ensure the treating physician's final report uses the most serious accurate ICD-10 code. "Cervical radiculopathy" yields 2-3x the COLOSSUS value of "neck sprain" for the same clinical presentation.
