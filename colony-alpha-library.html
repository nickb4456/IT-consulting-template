      <h2 class="entry-title">The Transformer — How Attention Changed Everything</h2>
      <p class="entry-meta">Architecture • 2017 • Foundation</p>
      
      <p>In June 2017, eight Google researchers published a paper titled "Attention Is All You Need." The title was almost arrogant. Recurrent neural networks had dominated sequence modeling for years. The paper proposed replacing them entirely with <span class="highlight">attention mechanisms</span>.</p>
      
      <p>The key insight: instead of processing sequences one step at a time (like reading a sentence word by word), process them <span class="fact">all at once</span> and let each element "attend" to every other element. The word "bank" can simultaneously consider "river" and "money" in the same sentence, resolving its meaning through context.</p>
      
      <p>The architecture has three components: <span class="fact">queries, keys, and values</span>. Each token generates a query ("What am I looking for?"), a key ("What do I offer?"), and a value ("What do I contain?"). Attention scores are computed by matching queries to keys; values are weighted by these scores.</p>
      
      <p>The math is simple. For a sequence of N tokens with embedding dimension D, attention is: <span class="fact">softmax(QK^T / √d) × V</span>. That's it. Matrix multiplications and a softmax. No recurrence, no convolutions.</p>
      
      <div class="real-world">
        <strong>Real-World Impact:</strong> Every large language model—GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama—is a Transformer. Every machine translation service, every code completion tool, every AI writing assistant. The architecture is so dominant that "Transformer alternatives" is itself a research subfield (Mamba, RWKV, state-space models). The Transformer didn't just succeed—it became the default.
      </div>
      
      <p>The 2017 paper has been cited over <span class="fact">100,000 times</span>. Not bad for eight researchers who thought attention might be enough.</p>
    </article>
    
    <article class="entry" id="scaling">
      <h2 class="entry-title">Scaling Laws — The Bitter Lesson Made Mathematical</h2>
      <p class="entry-meta">Training • Compute • Empirical Laws</p>
      
      <p>In 2020, OpenAI published "Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models." The paper fit power-law curves to model performance across six orders of magnitude of compute. The finding was uncomfortable: <span class="highlight">performance improves predictably with scale</span>.</p>
      
      <p>Double the parameters? Performance improves by a fixed amount. Double the training data? Same thing. Double the compute? Same. The relationship holds across <span class="fact">10,000,000×</span> differences in model size.</p>
      
      <p>The formula: <span class="fact">L(C) ≈ (C₀/C)^α</span>, where L is loss, C is compute, and α ≈ 0.05. This means a 10× increase in compute reduces loss by about 12%. Predictably. Reliably. No clever algorithms required.</p>
      
      <p>This is what Rich Sutton called "The Bitter Lesson": general methods that leverage computation ultimately dominate special methods that leverage human knowledge. We wanted AI to succeed because of our clever designs. Instead, it succeeds because we throw more compute at simple architectures.</p>
      
      <div class="real-world">
        <strong>Real-World Impact:</strong> Labs now plan multi-year roadmaps based on scaling projections. If GPT-5 requires 100× the compute of GPT-4, and scaling laws hold, teams can estimate its capabilities <span class="fact">before training begins</span>. This lets companies justify billion-dollar training runs—not because they're sure it'll work, but because the math says it should.
      </div>
      
      <p>The bitter lesson isn't that human insight doesn't matter. It's that human insight's job is to <span class="highlight">find architectures that scale</span>—and then get out of the way.</p>
    </article>
    
    <article class="entry" id="emergence">
      <h2 class="entry-title">Emergent Abilities — When More Becomes Different</h2>
      <p class="entry-meta">Capabilities • Scale • Phase Transitions</p>
      
      <p>A 1-billion parameter model can't do arithmetic reliably. A 10-billion parameter model struggles. A 100-billion parameter model suddenly can. The ability doesn't grow gradually—it <span class="highlight">emerges</span> above a threshold.</p>
      
      <p>Google's 2022 paper documented <span class="fact">137 emergent abilities</span> that appear only in models above certain sizes: multi-step arithmetic, word problems, code generation, theory of mind tasks, and more. Below the threshold: random performance. Above: human-level or better.</p>
      
      <p>This is what physicists call a <span class="fact">phase transition</span>. Water doesn't gradually become ice—it's liquid, then suddenly solid. Emergent abilities follow the same pattern. The model learns some internal representation incrementally, but the externally-visible capability snaps into existence.</p>
      
      <p>The troubling implication: we can't predict what new abilities will emerge at the next scale. GPT-4's ability to pass the bar exam wasn't specifically trained—it emerged from scale. What emerges at 10× GPT-4? We'll find out when we train it.</p>
      
      <div class="real-world">
        <strong>Real-World Impact:</strong> Emergence means capability curves have cliffs. A model that "can't do X" might be one training run away from doing X perfectly. This makes safety evaluation hard: you can't test for capabilities that don't exist yet but might appear with slightly more training.
      </div>
      
      <p>Critics argue emergence might be a measurement artifact—perhaps abilities grow smoothly but our benchmarks have sharp thresholds. The debate continues. But either way, the empirical fact remains: <span class="highlight">more becomes different</span>.</p>

    <article class="entry" id="context">
      <h2 class="entry-title">The Context Window Race — From 512 to 1 Million Tokens</h2>
      <p class="entry-meta">Architecture • Memory • Attention</p>
      
      <p>The original GPT had a context window of <span class="fact">512 tokens</span>—about one page of text. GPT-4 launched with 8,192, later expanded to 128,000. Claude offers 200,000. Gemini 1.5 processes <span class="fact">1 million tokens</span>—roughly 1,500 pages or 10 hours of video.</p>
      
      <p>Why does context length matter? Because memory is intelligence. A model with 512 tokens can answer questions about a paragraph. A model with 128,000 tokens can answer questions about an entire codebase. A model with 1 million tokens can watch a movie and discuss the plot.</p>
      
      <p>The challenge is attention's <span class="fact">O(N²) cost</span>. Double the context, quadruple the compute. At 1 million tokens, naive attention would require petabytes of memory. Solutions include: sparse attention (attend to subsets), sliding windows (attend locally + globally), ring attention (distribute across devices), and state-space models (compress history into fixed-size state).</p>
      
      <div class="real-world">
        <strong>Real-World Impact:</strong> Long context transforms what's possible. Lawyers can ask "What are all the liability clauses in this 500-page contract?" Developers can say "Here's my entire repo—find the bug." Researchers can prompt "Here are 50 papers on topic X—write a literature review." The model becomes less like a chatbot and more like a <span class="highlight">colleague who read everything</span>.
      </div>
      
      <p>The race isn't just about bragging rights. It's about making AI useful for real work, where real work rarely fits in a page.</p>

    <article class="entry" id="agents">
      <h2 class="entry-title">AI Agents — From Chatbots to Autonomous Systems</h2>
      <p class="entry-meta">Autonomy • Tool Use • Multi-Step Reasoning</p>
      
      <p>A chatbot responds to messages. An <span class="highlight">agent</span> takes actions.</p>
      
      <p>The difference is autonomy. When you ask ChatGPT "What's the weather?", it guesses based on training data. When you ask an agent, it calls a weather API, parses the response, and tells you the actual forecast. The agent has <span class="fact">tools</span>: web search, code execution, file access, API calls.</p>
      
      <p>But tools aren't enough. An agent needs <span class="fact">planning</span>: decomposing "Book me a flight to Tokyo" into subtasks (search flights, compare prices, check calendar, make reservation). It needs <span class="fact">memory</span>: remembering your airline preferences across sessions. And it needs <span class="fact">reflection</span>: recognizing when a plan failed and trying a different approach.</p>
      
      <p>Current architectures string these together with prompting: "Think step by step. Use these tools. Reflect on your actions." It's hacky. It works surprisingly well.</p>
      
      <div class="real-world">
        <strong>Real-World Impact:</strong> AI agents already handle customer service tickets (Intercom, Zendesk), schedule meetings (Reclaim, Clockwise), write and debug code (Devin, Cursor), and manage entire workflows (Zapier AI). The pattern is consistent: <span class="highlight">tasks that required a human in the loop can often run autonomously with an LLM in the loop</span>. The human becomes a supervisor, not an executor.
      </div>
      
      <p>The question isn't whether AI agents will transform knowledge work. It's how quickly humans adapt to working alongside autonomous colleagues.</p>
    </article>
    
    <article class="entry" id="multimodal">
      <h2 class="entry-title">Multimodal Models — Seeing, Hearing, Speaking</h2>
      <p class="entry-meta">Vision • Audio • Cross-Modal Learning</p>
      
      <p>For years, we trained separate models: one for text, one for images, one for audio. GPT couldn't see. DALL-E couldn't chat. Whisper couldn't generate.</p>
      
      <p>Multimodal models unify everything. GPT-4V processes images alongside text. Gemini handles video, audio, and code in the same context. The architecture is simple: <span class="fact">encode everything as tokens</span>. A 256×256 image becomes 256 visual tokens. An audio clip becomes speech tokens. The Transformer doesn't care what the tokens represent—it just learns attention patterns.</p>
      
      <p>The result is emergent cross-modal reasoning. Show the model a chart and ask "What trend does this show?" It connects visual patterns to linguistic concepts. Play an audio clip and ask "What emotion is the speaker feeling?" It maps prosody to sentiment.</p>
      
      <p>The training data is the challenge. Text is abundant—trillions of tokens from the internet. Image-text pairs are rarer. Video-text pairs rarer still. Labs increasingly create synthetic training data: use one model to caption images, another to describe videos, then train multimodal models on the synthetic annotations.</p>
      
      <div class="real-world">
        <strong>Real-World Impact:</strong> Multimodal AI powers: Google Lens (point your camera, get answers), medical imaging analysis (read X-rays like radiologists), accessibility tools (describe images for blind users), video understanding (summarize meetings, extract action items), and robotics (see the world, plan actions). The model doesn't need separate systems for each modality—one architecture handles everything.
      </div>
      
      <p>The goal isn't models that process multiple modalities. It's models that understand the world the way humans do—through <span class="highlight">all senses at once</span>.</p>
