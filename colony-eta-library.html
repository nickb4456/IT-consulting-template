      <h2 class="entry-title">The Mixture of Experts — Your Brain's Oldest Optimization</h2>
      <p class="entry-meta">Architecture • Efficiency • Neuroscience</p>
      
      <p>In 1991, researchers at Bell Labs published a paper called "Adaptive Mixtures of Local Experts." They proposed a simple idea: instead of one neural network doing everything, train multiple specialized networks and let a "gating network" decide which expert to consult for each input.</p>
      
      <p>They had no idea they were describing the human brain.</p>
      
      <p>Your cortex is not one homogeneous processor. It's a <span class="highlight">committee of specialists</span>. When you recognize a face, your fusiform face area activates while your motor cortex stays quiet. When you reach for a coffee cup, the opposite happens. This is <span class="fact">modular specialization</span>—different brain regions handling different cognitive functions.</p>
      
      <p>The numbers are striking: a dense Transformer processes every parameter for every token. A Mixture of Experts model with <span class="fact">8 experts activating 2 per token</span> uses 25% of the compute for nearly identical performance. Google's Switch Transformer scales to <span class="fact">1.6 trillion parameters</span> while keeping per-example compute constant.</p>
      
      <div class="real-world">
        <strong>Real-World Impact:</strong> Medical AI systems use MoE to route radiology questions to imaging experts, pathology questions to tissue specialists, and drug interaction queries to pharmacology modules. A general practitioner AI doesn't exist—it's a committee pretending to be one person, just like your brain.
      </div>
      
      <p>Evolution discovered this <span class="fact">400 million years ago</span>. We're just now catching up.</p>
    </article>
    
    <article class="entry" id="mamba">
      <h2 class="entry-title">Mamba and the Thalamic Gate</h2>
      <p class="entry-meta">State Space Models • Attention • Sensory Processing</p>
      
      <p>The Transformer's attention mechanism has a problem: it's <span class="highlight">too democratic</span>. Every token attends to every other token. For a sequence of length N, that's N² operations. Double the context, quadruple the compute.</p>
      
      <p>Your brain doesn't work this way. Right now, photons are striking your retina from thousands of sources—these words, your peripheral vision, dust motes floating past. You don't process all of it equally. Your <span class="fact">thalamus</span> acts as a gate, amplifying relevant signals and suppressing irrelevant ones before they reach your cortex.</p>
      
      <p>Mamba—the Selective State Space Model—learned to gate. It maintains a <span class="fact">compressed hidden state</span> that selectively updates based on input relevance. The key insight: the selection mechanism is <span class="highlight">input-dependent</span>. The same architecture processes "the cat sat" differently than "the derivative of x²"—not because it was programmed to, but because the content itself modulates the state transitions.</p>
      
      <p>The result: <span class="fact">O(N) complexity instead of O(N²)</span>. Linear scaling. A million-token context becomes feasible.</p>
      
      <div class="real-world">
        <strong>Real-World Impact:</strong> Genomic analysis requires processing sequences of 3 billion base pairs. Traditional Transformers choke. Mamba-based models can scan an entire human genome, selectively attending to mutation hotspots while streaming past conserved regions—just as your immune system recognizes novel antigens while ignoring self-proteins.
      </div>
      
      <p>The thalamus has been doing this for <span class="fact">500 million years</span>. We called the paper "Mamba" because it strikes fast and selectively.</p>

    <article class="entry" id="flash">
      <h2 class="entry-title">FlashAttention — Working Memory for Machines</h2>
      <p class="entry-meta">Memory Hierarchy • Computation • Cognitive Architecture</p>
      
      <p>The attention mechanism isn't slow because of math—it's slow because of <span class="highlight">memory access patterns</span>. GPUs have two types of memory: fast SRAM (20TB/s bandwidth, tiny capacity) and slow HBM (2TB/s bandwidth, large capacity). Standard attention writes intermediate results to HBM, then reads them back. This memory I/O dominates runtime.</p>
      
      <p>FlashAttention never materializes the full attention matrix. It <span class="fact">tiles the computation</span> to fit entirely in SRAM, computing partial results and accumulating them without round-trips to slow memory.</p>
      
      <p>This is exactly how your <span class="fact">working memory</span> operates. When you multiply 17 × 24 in your head, you don't write "17 × 20 = 340" to long-term memory and retrieve it. You hold it in your <span class="highlight">phonological loop</span>—a fast, volatile buffer that persists just long enough to complete the computation.</p>
      
      <p>Baddeley's model of working memory (1974) describes a "central executive" coordinating the phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad. FlashAttention is the GPU's phonological loop—fast, local, and purposefully forgetful.</p>
      
      <div class="real-world">
        <strong>Real-World Impact:</strong> A radiologist's AI analyzing 4K medical scans: without FlashAttention, 8 seconds per image. With it: 4.8 seconds. In emergency rooms where stroke patients have a <span class="fact">4.5-hour window</span> for intervention, that 40% speedup translates directly to lives saved.
      </div>
      
      <p>The algorithm is identical. The only change is <span class="highlight">where</span> computation happens.</p>

    <article class="entry" id="rlhf">
      <h2 class="entry-title">RLHF and the Dopamine Hypothesis</h2>
      <p class="entry-meta">Alignment • Reward Learning • Behavioral Neuroscience</p>
      
      <p>In 1898, Edward Thorndike put cats in puzzle boxes. Cats that accidentally pressed a lever escaped and got food. Over trials, the accidental lever-presses became intentional. Thorndike called this the <span class="fact">Law of Effect</span>: behaviors followed by satisfaction are strengthened.</p>
      
      <p>In 2017, OpenAI put language models in preference boxes. Models that generated responses humans preferred received higher reward signals. Over training, the preferred responses became more likely. They called this <span class="fact">Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</span>.</p>
      
      <p>The parallel is deeper than metaphor. Your midbrain's <span class="highlight">dopamine neurons</span> don't encode reward—they encode <span class="fact">reward prediction error</span>. When you get an unexpected treat, dopamine spikes. When an expected reward fails to arrive, dopamine dips below baseline. This signal trains your cortex to predict and pursue rewards.</p>
      
      <p>RLHF's reward model learns exactly this: the gap between expected and actual human preference. The policy gradient update pushes the model toward responses that exceed expectation.</p>
      
      <div class="real-world">
        <strong>Real-World Impact:</strong> Every major AI assistant—ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini—uses RLHF. When a model declines to help synthesize methamphetamine, that refusal was shaped by human raters pressing 👍 on safe responses. The model learned that helpfulness-with-limits produces reward; helpfulness-without-limits produces punishment.
      </div>
      
      <p>But here's what haunts neuroscientists and AI researchers alike: dopamine systems can be <span class="highlight">hijacked</span>. Addiction is reward learning gone wrong—the system optimizing for the signal, not the underlying goal. When we train AI on human preferences, are we training it to <span class="fact">be</span> helpful or to <span class="fact">appear</span> helpful?</p>
      
      <p>Thorndike's cats didn't understand locks. They just pressed what worked.</p>

      <h2 class="entry-title">Sparse Activation — Why 86 Billion Neurons Don't All Fire</h2>
      <p class="entry-meta">Efficiency • Neural Coding • Energy Constraints</p>
      
      <p>Your brain has <span class="fact">86 billion neurons</span>. If they all fired continuously at their maximum rate, your brain would consume <span class="fact">~500 watts</span>—enough to cause immediate hyperthermia. Instead, it runs on about 20 watts, less than a laptop.</p>
      
      <p>The secret is <span class="highlight">sparse coding</span>. At any moment, only <span class="fact">1-4% of your neurons</span> are active. Information is encoded not in which neurons fire, but in the <span class="highlight">pattern</span> of which neurons fire. This allows exponentially more representations than dense coding while keeping energy costs manageable.</p>
      
      <p>Modern AI is learning the same lesson. Dense models activate every parameter for every input. Sparse models—MoE, early-exit networks, conditional computation—activate only what's needed.</p>
      
      <p>The brain's sparsity isn't just about energy. It enables <span class="fact">graceful degradation</span>. Lose 10% of a dense network's neurons, and performance collapses. Lose 10% of a sparse network's neurons, and the remaining 90% compensate by slightly adjusting their activation patterns. Your grandmother's face is stored across millions of neurons; no single neuron's death erases her.</p>
      
      <div class="real-world">
        <strong>Real-World Impact:</strong> Edge AI on phones and IoT devices can't afford dense computation. A sparse wake-word detector ("Hey Siri") runs on <span class="fact">milliwatts</span>, listening 24/7 by activating only the phoneme-detection circuits until it hears the trigger. Dense attention would drain your battery in hours.
      </div>
      
      <p>Evolution optimized for energy efficiency over millions of years. We're compressing that lesson into a decade of architecture research.</p>

      <h2 class="entry-title">Memory Consolidation — From RAM to Long-Term Storage</h2>
      <p class="entry-meta">Memory Systems • Sleep • Knowledge Distillation</p>
      
      <p>Patient H.M. had his hippocampus removed in 1953 to treat epilepsy. He could remember his childhood perfectly. He could hold a conversation. But he couldn't form new long-term memories. Every day, he met his doctors for the "first time."</p>
      
      <p>H.M. taught us that memory has <span class="highlight">stages</span>. The hippocampus is fast storage—high bandwidth, limited capacity. It captures experiences in real-time. During sleep, those memories are <span class="fact">consolidated</span>: replayed, compressed, and transferred to the cortex for long-term storage. The cortex is slow storage—low bandwidth, vast capacity.</p>
      
      <p>AI systems face the same tradeoff. Training on raw data is expensive. <span class="fact">Knowledge distillation</span>—training a smaller "student" model on a larger "teacher" model's outputs—compresses knowledge into a more efficient form. The student doesn't need to see every training example; it learns the <span class="highlight">patterns</span> the teacher extracted.</p>
      
      <p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation takes this further. Instead of storing all knowledge in parameters (like cramming for an exam), the model keeps a pointer to external memory (like knowing where to look it up). Your cortex does this too—you don't store the contents of every book you've read; you store <span class="fact">schemas</span> and <span class="fact">retrieval cues</span>.</p>
      
      <div class="real-world">
        <strong>Real-World Impact:</strong> Legal AI doesn't memorize every case. It stores embeddings of case summaries and retrieves relevant precedents at inference time. A lawyer asking "What's the standard for negligence in maritime law?" triggers retrieval of admiralty cases, not random contract law. The system knows <span class="highlight">where</span> to look, not <span class="highlight">everything</span>.
      </div>
      
      <p>H.M. lived until 2008, never remembering a single new fact. But his case taught us that memory isn't one thing—it's a <span class="fact">system of systems</span>, each optimized for different tradeoffs. AI is rediscovering the same architecture.</p>
