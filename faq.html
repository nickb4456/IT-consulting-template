                    <p>Simple AI implementations (chatbots, document templates) take 1-2 weeks. Custom workflow automation takes 4-8 weeks.</p>
                    <p>Complex integrations with existing business systems take 2-4 months. Most small business projects complete within 6 weeks from kickoff to full deployment.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>AI augments employees rather than replacing them. It handles repetitive tasks so staff can focus on higher-value work.</p>
                    <p>Most businesses using AI report higher employee satisfaction as tedious work decreases. The goal is amplification, not elimination—letting humans do what humans do best.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>AI is safe for law firms when deployed correctly with proper data handling.</p>
                    <p>Cloud AI tools like ChatGPT send data to external servers, which may violate client confidentiality. Private AI deployments that run on the firm's own infrastructure keep all data in-house and satisfy Rule 1.6 requirements.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Can AI help with legal document drafting?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes. AI can draft demand letters, discovery responses, contracts, and client communications in minutes instead of hours.</p>
                    <p>Attorneys review and refine the output. Firms report 60-85% time reduction on routine documents. The AI learns your firm's voice and templates over time.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">What is private AI deployment?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Private AI deployment runs AI models on your own hardware instead of cloud services. Your data never leaves your building.</p>
                    <p>This is essential for law firms, healthcare providers, and financial advisors handling confidential information. It costs more upfront but eliminates ongoing API fees and confidentiality concerns.</p>
