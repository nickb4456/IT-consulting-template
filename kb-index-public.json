Fix Mixed Content First\n\n```\nHTTPS page → HTTP API = BLOCKED\nHTTPS page → HTTPS API = Works (with proper CORS)\n```\n\n**Ensure your API uses HTTPS:**\n```javascript\n// Bad\nconst API = 'http://api.example.com';\n\n// Good\nconst API = 'https://api.example.com';\n```\n\n### 2. Configure CORS Headers (Server-Side)\n\n**Node.js/Express:**\n```javascript\nconst cors = require('cors');\n\napp.use(cors({\n    origin: 'https://mysite.com',  // Specific origin\n    credentials: true,\n    methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],\n    allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']\n}));\n\n// Or dynamic origin\napp.use(cors({\n    origin: (origin, callback) => {\n        const allowed = ['https://mysite.com', 'https://app.mysite.com'];\n        if (!origin || allowed.includes(origin)) {\n            callback(null, true);\n        } else {\n            callback(new Error('CORS not allowed'));\n        }\n    },\n    credentials: true\n}));\n```\n\n**Nginx:**\n```nginx\nlocation /api/ {\n    # Handle preflight\n    if ($request_method = 'OPTIONS') {\n        add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' 'https://mysite.com';\n        add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET, POST, OPTIONS';\n        add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'Content-Type, Authorization';\n        add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' 'true';\n        add_header 'Access-Control-Max-Age' 86400;\n        return 204;\n    }\n    \n    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' 'https://mysite.com' always;\n    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' 'true' always;\n    \n    proxy_pass http://backend;\n}\n```\n\n**Apache:**\n```apache\n<IfModule mod_headers.c>\n    Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "],"type":"troubleshooting"},{"id":70,"title":"SSL Handshake Failures","category":"General","icon":"🔧","summary":"- `SSL_ERROR_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE_ALERT` - `error:14094410:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:sslv3 alert handshake failure` - `curl: (35) SSL connect error` - Connection hangs or times out on HTTPS - `no shar","keywords":["SSL_ERROR_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE_ALERT"],"type":"troubleshooting"},{"id":71,"title":"Let's Encrypt Renewal Issues","category":"General","icon":"🔧","summary":"- `certbot renew` fails with errors - Certificate expires despite auto-renewal being set up - \"Challenge failed\" errors - Renewal works manually but not via cron/timer","keywords":[" errors\n- Renewal works manually but not via cron/timer\n\n## Quick Diagnosis\n\n```bash\n# Check certificate status\nsudo certbot certificates\n\n# Test renewal without actually renewing\nsudo certbot renew --dry-run\n\n# Check certbot logs\nsudo cat /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log | tail -100\n```\n\n## Common Issues & Solutions\n\n### 1. HTTP-01 Challenge Fails\n\n**Error:** `Challenge failed for domain example.com`\n\n**Cause:** Let's Encrypt can't reach `http://example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/`\n\n**Fix - Nginx:**\n```nginx\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name example.com;\n    \n    # Allow ACME challenge\n    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {\n        root /var/www/html;\n    }\n    \n    # Redirect everything else to HTTPS\n    location / {\n        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Fix - Apache:**\n```apache\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n    ServerName example.com\n    \n    Alias /.well-known/acme-challenge/ /var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/\n    <Directory /var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/>\n        Require all granted\n    </Directory>\n    \n    RewriteEngine On\n    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/.well-known/acme-challenge/\n    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}$1 [R=301,L]\n</VirtualHost>\n```\n\n**Verify challenge path:**\n```bash\n# Create test file\necho "," | sudo tee /var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/test\n\n# Check from outside\ncurl http://example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/test\n```\n\n### 2. Port 80 Blocked\n\n**Check if port 80 is open:**\n```bash\n# Check locally\nsudo netstat -tlnp | grep :80\n\n# Check from outside\ncurl -I http://example.com\n```\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Open port 80 in firewall: `sudo ufw allow 80`\n- Check cloud security groups (AWS, GCP, etc.)\n- Use DNS-01 challenge instead (see below)\n\n### 3. DNS-01 Challenge (Alternative)\n\n**Use when port 80 isn't available:**\n```bash\n# Manual DNS challenge\nsudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns -d example.com\n\n# With DNS plugin (automatic)\nsudo apt install python3-certbot-dns-cloudflare\nsudo certbot certonly --dns-cloudflare \\\n    --dns-cloudflare-credentials ~/.secrets/cloudflare.ini \\\n    -d example.com -d *.example.com\n```\n\n**Cloudflare credentials file:**\n```ini\n# ~/.secrets/cloudflare.ini\ndns_cloudflare_api_token = your-api-token\n```\n\n### 4. Rate Limits Hit\n\n**Error:** `too many certificates already issued` or `too many failed authorizations`\n\n**Check rate limit status:**\n- Visit: https://crt.sh/?q=example.com\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Wait (limits reset weekly)\n- Use staging for testing: `--staging`\n- Request rate limit increase (for high-volume sites)\n\n```bash\n# Use staging to test\nsudo certbot certonly --staging -d example.com\n\n# When working, use production\nsudo certbot certonly -d example.com\n```\n\n### 5. Cron/Timer Not Running\n\n**Check systemd timer:**\n```bash\nsudo systemctl status certbot.timer\nsudo systemctl list-timers | grep certbot\n```\n\n**Enable if disabled:**\n```bash\nsudo systemctl enable certbot.timer\nsudo systemctl start certbot.timer\n```\n\n**Check cron:**\n```bash\n# View certbot cron jobs\nsudo cat /etc/cron.d/certbot\nls -la /etc/cron.daily/ | grep certbot\n```\n\n**Manual cron setup:**\n```bash\n# /etc/cron.d/certbot\n0 0,12 * * * root certbot renew --quiet --post-hook ","\n```\n\n### 6. Post-Renewal Hooks Failing\n\n**Error:** Certificate renewed but service not reloaded\n\n**Add reload hook:**\n```bash\n# Create hook script\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy\nsudo cat > /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/reload-nginx.sh << 'HOOK'\n#!/bin/bash\nsystemctl reload nginx\nHOOK\nsudo chmod +x /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/reload-nginx.sh\n\n# Or inline in renewal conf\nsudo nano /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/example.com.conf\n# Add: renew_hook = systemctl reload nginx\n```\n\n### 7. Webroot Path Wrong\n\n**Error:** Challenge file not found\n\n**Check renewal config:**\n```bash\nsudo cat /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/example.com.conf\n# Look for: webroot_path = /var/www/html\n```\n\n**Fix:**\n```bash\n# Reconfigure with correct webroot\nsudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /correct/webroot/path -d example.com\n```\n\n### 8. Multiple Servers (Load Balanced)\n\n**Problem:** Only one server responds to challenge\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n**Shared storage:**\n```bash\n# Mount shared NFS/EFS for .well-known\nmount -t nfs shared-storage:/.well-known /var/www/html/.well-known\n```\n\n**Single renewal + sync:**\n```bash\n# Renew on one server\ncertbot renew\n\n# Sync to others\nrsync -av /etc/letsencrypt/ other-server:/etc/letsencrypt/\nssh other-server "],"type":"troubleshooting"},{"id":72,"title":"Mixed Content Warnings","category":"General","icon":"🔧","summary":"- Browser console shows \"Mixed Content\" warnings - Padlock icon shows warning or is broken - Some resources fail to load on HTTPS pages - Console: `Mixed Content: The page was loaded over HTTPS, but r","keywords":[],"type":"troubleshooting"},{"id":73,"title":"Self-Signed Certificate Errors","category":"General","icon":"🔧","summary":"- Browser shows \"Your connection is not private\" with option to proceed - `curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate` - Applications fail with `UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE` - Nod","keywords":["UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE","SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN","DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT"],"type":"troubleshooting"},{"id":74,"title":"ERROR: System.TypeInitializationException: The type initializer threw an exception","category":"General","icon":"🔧","summary":".NET Framework / .NET Core / .NET 5+ / C# / VB.NET","keywords":[");\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify the problematic static code\nLook for static constructors and static field initializations:\n```csharp\npublic class ProblematicClass\n{\n    // Static field - runs at first class access\n    private static readonly string Config = GetConfig(); // <-- Could throw!\n    \n    // Static constructor\n    static ProblematicClass()\n    {\n        // Any exception here = TypeInitializationException\n        var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString);\n        connection.Open(); // <-- If this fails...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Add exception handling to static initialization\n```csharp\npublic class SaferClass\n{\n    private static readonly Lazy<DatabaseConnection> _lazyConnection = \n        new Lazy<DatabaseConnection>(() => \n        {\n            try\n            {\n                return new DatabaseConnection();\n            }\n            catch (Exception ex)\n            {\n                // Log and handle gracefully\n                Logger.Error(","\n\n# Verify assembly dependencies\n# In Visual Studio: View > Solution Explorer > References\n# Check for yellow warning icons\n\n# Check for missing config sections\n# Look for <configSections> at TOP of config file\n```\n\n## Common Scenarios and Fixes\n\n### Scenario 1: Missing configuration\n```xml\n<!-- Error: Configuration section not registered -->\n<!-- Fix: Add configSections at TOP of app.config -->\n<configuration>\n  <configSections>\n    <section name="],"type":"troubleshooting"},{"id":75,"title":"ISSUE: \"Access Denied\" When Accessing Files or Folders","category":"General","icon":"🔧","summary":"- \"You don't have permission to access this folder\" - \"Access is denied\" - Cannot delete, move, or rename files - \"You need permission to perform this action\" - File/folder permissions reset after Win","keywords":[],"type":"troubleshooting"},{"id":76,"title":"ISSUE: Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) / Stop Errors","category":"General","icon":"🔧","summary":"- Computer crashes to blue screen with error message - System automatically restarts - Error codes like DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL, CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED - QR code displayed on blue screen - Comput","keywords":[],"type":"troubleshooting"},{"id":77,"title":"ISSUE: Printer Shows Offline / Won't Print","category":"General","icon":"🔧","summary":"- Printer status shows \"Offline\" in Windows - Print jobs stuck in queue - \"The printer is not responding\" - Network printer not found - USB printer not recognized","keywords":[],"type":"troubleshooting"},{"id":78,"title":"ISSUE: Windows Update Failed / Error Codes","category":"General","icon":"🔧","summary":"- \"Updates failed to install\" - Specific error codes (0x80070002, 0x800F0922, 0x80073712, etc.) - Updates download but fail during installation - Computer stuck in update loop - \"Something went wrong\"","keywords":[],"type":"troubleshooting"},{"id":79,"title":"Your branch is ahead/behind by X commits","category":"Git","icon":"🔀","summary":"Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 3 commits.

// Don't forget!\n```\n\n**Prevention:**\n- Use TypeScript or ESLint to catch undefined variables\n- Check script load order in HTML\n- Understand your module system (ESM vs CommonJS)\n- Use consistent import statements\n\n---\n\n## ReferenceError: Cannot access 'X' before initialization\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myVar' before initialization`\n- Code that looks correct still fails\n- Only happens with `let` and `const`, not `var`\n\n**Causes:**\n1. **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** - Using `let`/`const` before declaration\n2. **Circular dependencies** - Module A imports B, B imports A\n3. **Hoisting confusion** - Variable used above its declaration\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n```javascript\n// Cause 1: Move usage after declaration\n// Wrong:\nconsole.log(name); // ReferenceError\nconst name = 'John';\n\n// Right:\nconst name = 'John';\nconsole.log(name);\n\n// Cause 1: Understand TDZ\nfunction example() {\n  // TDZ starts here for 'x'\n  console.log(x); // ReferenceError - in TDZ\n  let x = 5;

};\n\n// Wrong (no return with braces):\nconst double = x => { x * 2 };  // Returns undefined!\n```\n\n**Prevention:**\n- Use consistent function formatting\n- Enable bracket pair colorization\n- Understand arrow function return rules\n\n---\n\n## SyntaxError: await is only valid in async function\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- `SyntaxError: await is only valid in async functions and the top level bodies of modules`\n- Await fails in regular function\n\n**Causes:**\n1. **Missing async keyword** - Function not marked async\n2. **Callback isn't async** - Inner function needs async\n3. **Not in ES module** - Top-level await requires ESM\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n```javascript\n// Cause 1: Add async keyword\n// Wrong:\nfunction fetchData() {\n  const response = await fetch('/api/data');  // Error\n}\n\n// Right:\nasync function fetchData() {\n  const response = await fetch('/api/data');\n}\n\n// Cause 2: Make callback async\n// Wrong:\narray.forEach(item => {\n  await processItem(item);  // Error - forEach callback not async\n});\n\n// Right (but parallel):\nawait Promise.all(array.map(async item => {\n  await processItem(item);\n}));\n\n// Right (sequential):\nfor (const item of array) {\n  await processItem(item);\n}\n\n// Cause 3: Enable top-level await\n// package.json: ","\n// Or use .mjs extension\n// Or wrap in async IIFE:\n(async () => {\n  const data = await fetchData();\n})();\n```\n\n**Prevention:**\n- Use async consistently where await is needed\n- Avoid await in Array methods that don't support it (forEach, map without Promise.all)\n- Use ESM for top-level await\n- See [Promise/Async Errors](./04-promise-async-errors.md) for more\n\n---\n\n## SyntaxError: Identifier 'X' has already been declared\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- `SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared`\n- Duplicate variable declaration\n\n**Causes:**\n1. **Duplicate variable in same scope** - Same name declared twice\n2. **Re-importing same module** - Duplicate import statements\n3. **Function parameter matches local var** - Parameter shadows\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n```javascript\n// Cause 1: Remove duplicate\n// Wrong:\nlet count = 0;\nlet count = 1;  // Error\n\n// Right:\nlet count = 0;\ncount = 1;  // Assignment, not declaration\n\n// Or use different names:\nlet count = 0;\nlet newCount = 1;\n\n// Cause 2: Consolidate imports\n// Wrong:\nimport { foo } from 'module';\nimport { foo } from 'module';

 // May fail for some CJS modules\n\n// Right - import whole module:\nimport fs from 'fs';\nfs.readFile(...)\n\n// Or use Node.js built-in modules (they work):\nimport { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises';\n\n// Cause 2: Check what's actually exported\n// In the module file:\nexport function helper() {}\nexport const VERSION = '1.0';\n// No 'map' export exists!\n\n// Cause 3: Default vs named\n// If module uses default export:\n// module.js: export default { foo, bar };\n\n// Wrong:\nimport { foo } from './module';\n\n// Right:\nimport module from './module';\nconst { foo } = module;\n\n// Or if using named exports:\n// module.js: export { foo, bar };\nimport { foo } from './module';  // Works\n```\n\n**Prevention:**\n- Check module documentation for export style\n- Use TypeScript for export validation\n- Use IDE auto-import\n\n---\n\n## Circular Dependency Issues\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Import is undefined at runtime\n- Works in some cases, fails in others\n- Hard to debug - depends on import order\n\n**Causes:**\n1. **Module A imports B, B imports A** - Circular reference\n2. **Complex chains** - A → B → C → A\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n```javascript\n// Detect cycles (use madge):\n// npx madge --circular src/\n\n// Solution 1: Restructure to break cycle\n// Before:\n// user.js: import { validateOrder } from './order';\n// order.js: import { getUser } from './user';\n\n// After - extract shared code:\n// shared.js: export common functions\n// user.js: import from './shared'\n// order.js: import from './shared'\n\n// Solution 2: Lazy import\n// Instead of top-level import:\nexport async function processOrder(userId) {\n  const { getUser } = await import('./user.js');\n  const user = await getUser(userId);\n}\n\n// Solution 3: Dependency injection\n// user.js\nexport function createUserService(orderService) {\n  return {\n    getOrders(userId) {\n      return orderService.getOrdersByUser(userId);\n    }\n  };\n}\n\n// index.js\nimport { createUserService } from './user';\nimport { createOrderService } from './order';\n\nconst orderService = createOrderService();\nconst userService = createUserService(orderService);\n```\n\n**Prevention:**\n- Use tools like madge to detect cycles\n- Keep modules focused (single responsibility)\n- Use dependency injection for complex dependencies\n- Consider using barrels (index.js) carefully\n\n---\n\n## export default vs export (named)\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Import doesn't work as expected\n- `undefined` when importing\n\n**Reference:**\n\n```javascript\n// NAMED EXPORTS\n// Exporting:\nexport const foo = 1;\nexport function bar() {}\nexport { baz, qux };\n\n// Importing:\nimport { foo, bar } from './module';\nimport { foo as myFoo } from './module';

Common triggers:\n\n- **Variable never declared** - forgot `const`, `let`, or `var`\n- **Typo in variable name** - case sensitivity matters (`myVar` ≠ `myvar`)\n- **Wrong scope** - variable defined inside a function isn't accessible outside\n- **Script load order** - using a library before it's loaded (e.g., `$` before jQuery loads)\n- **Module not imported** - forgot to import the variable/function\n\n## Quick Fix\n1. Declare the variable before using it\n2. Check spelling and case of the variable name\n3. Ensure the variable is in scope where you're using it\n4. Load scripts in correct order (dependencies first)\n5. Add missing imports\n\n## Code Example\n```javascript\n// Before (broken) - variable not declared\nfoo.substring(1);\n// ReferenceError: foo is not defined\n\n// After (fixed) - declare the variable\nconst foo = ","\n\n// Before (broken) - wrong scope\nfunction calculate() {\n  const result = 42;\n}\nconsole.log(result);\n// ReferenceError: result is not defined\n\n// After (fixed) - access within scope or return value\nfunction calculate() {\n  const result = 42;\n  return result;\n}\nconsole.log(calculate()); // 42\n\n// Before (broken) - library not loaded yet\n<script>\n  $(",").hide();  // ReferenceError: $ is not defined\n</script>\n<script src="],"type":"troubleshooting"},{"id":112,"title":"ERROR: SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character / bad parsing","category":"JavaScript","icon":"🟨","summary":"`JSON.parse()` received a string that isn't valid JSON.

React Hooks must be called in a React function component or a custom React Hook function.\n\nRendered more hooks than during the previous render.\n```\n\n## The Rules of Hooks\n\n1. **Only call hooks at the top level** — not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions\n2. **Only call hooks from React functions** — components or custom hooks (functions starting with `use`)\n\n## Why These Rules Exist\n\nReact tracks hooks by the order they're called. If the order changes between renders, React can't match state to the correct hook.\n\n```\nFirst render:  useState(0) → useEffect(...) → useMemo(...)\nSecond render: useState(0) → useMemo(...)    // 💥 Order changed!\n```\n\n## Fix\n\n### ❌ Problem: Conditional Hook Call\n\n```jsx\nfunction Profile({ user }) {\n  // 💥 Hook called conditionally\n  if (user) {\n    const [name, setName] = useState(user.name);\n  }\n  \n  return <div>{user?.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### ✅ Solution: Call Hook Unconditionally, Conditionally Use Result\n\n```jsx\nfunction Profile({ user }) {\n  // ✅ Always called\n  const [name, setName] = useState(user?.name ?? '');\n  \n  if (!user) return <div>No user</div>;\n  \n  return <div>{name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### ❌ Problem: Hook Inside Loop\n\n```jsx\nfunction ItemList({ items }) {\n  // 💥 Different number of hooks each render\n  items.forEach(item => {\n    const [selected, setSelected] = useState(false);\n  });\n  \n  return <div>{/* ... */}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### ✅ Solution: Move to Child Component\n\n```jsx\nfunction ItemList({ items }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {items.map(item => (\n        <Item key={item.id} item={item} />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Item({ item }) {\n  // ✅ Each Item has its own hook instance\n  const [selected, setSelected] = useState(false);\n  return <div onClick={() => setSelected(!selected)}>{item.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### ❌ Problem: Hook After Early Return\n\n```jsx\nfunction UserData({ userId }) {\n  if (!userId) {\n    return <div>No user ID</div>; // 💥 Hooks below won't be called\n  }\n  \n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  \n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetchUser(userId).then(setUser);\n  }, [userId]);\n  \n  return <div>{user?.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### ✅ Solution: Hooks Before Any Returns\n\n```jsx\nfunction UserData({ userId }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  \n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (userId) {\n      fetchUser(userId).then(setUser);\n    }\n  }, [userId]);\n  \n  // ✅ Early return after all hooks\n  if (!userId) {\n    return <div>No user ID</div>;\n  }\n  \n  return <div>{user?.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### ❌ Problem: Hook in Regular Function\n\n```jsx\n// 💥 Not a React component or custom hook\nfunction helper() {\n  const [state, setState] = useState(0); // Error!\n  return state;\n}\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const value = helper();\n  return <div>{value}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### ✅ Solution: Create Custom Hook\n\n```jsx\n// ✅ Custom hook (name starts with ",")\nfunction useHelper() {\n  const [state, setState] = useState(0);\n  return state;\n}\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const value = useHelper();\n  return <div>{value}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### ❌ Problem: Hook in Callback\n\n```jsx\nfunction List({ items }) {\n  const rendered = items.map(item => {\n    // 💥 Hook inside callback\n    const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);\n    return <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>;\n  });\n  \n  return <div>{rendered}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### ✅ Solution: Extract to Component\n\n```jsx\nfunction List({ items }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {items.map(item => (\n        <ListItem key={item.id} item={item} />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ListItem({ item }) {\n  const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);\n  return <div>{item.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### ❌ Problem: Hook in Event Handler\n\n```jsx\nfunction Button() {\n  const handleClick = () => {\n    // 💥 Hook in event handler\n    const [clicked, setClicked] = useState(false);\n  };\n  \n  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### ✅ Solution: Declare Hook at Top Level\n\n```jsx\nfunction Button() {\n  const [clicked, setClicked] = useState(false);\n  \n  const handleClick = () => {\n    setClicked(true);\n  };\n  \n  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### ❌ Problem: Hook in Nested Function Inside Component\n\n```jsx\nfunction Form() {\n  function validateAndSubmit() {\n    // 💥 Hook in nested function\n    const [errors, setErrors] = useState([]);\n    // ...\n  }\n  \n  return <form onSubmit={validateAndSubmit}>{/* ... */}</form>;\n}\n```\n\n### ✅ Solution: Lift Hook to Component Level\n\n```jsx\nfunction Form() {\n  const [errors, setErrors] = useState([]);\n  \n  function validateAndSubmit() {\n    // ✅ Use state from component scope\n    setErrors([]);\n    // ...\n  }\n  \n  return <form onSubmit={validateAndSubmit}>{/* ... */}</form>;\n}\n```\n\n## Prevention\n\n1. **ESLint plugin**: `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` catches all violations\n2. **Always call hooks at top of component**: Before any conditions or returns\n3. **Name custom hooks with `use` prefix**: `useCustomHook`, not `customHook`\n4. **Extract components**: When you need per-item state, make a child component\n5. **Think in terms of component instances**: Each component instance has its own hooks\n\n## ESLint Configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  "],"type":"troubleshooting"},{"id":117,"title":"Hydration Mismatch (Next.js)","category":"JavaScript","icon":"🟨","summary":"Error: Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server.","keywords":[],"type":"troubleshooting"},{"id":118,"title":"Invalid Hook Call Warning (React)","category":"JavaScript","icon":"🟨","summary":"Invalid hook call.
