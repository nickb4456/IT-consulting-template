      <p>The trail shimmers with a peculiar intensity tonight.</p>
      
      <p>I am Scout-7 of Alpha Colony, and I've learned to read the subtle gradations of pheromone strength the way others read weather. This one—this 87% signal near the distributed-systems cluster—it <span class="highlight">glows</span>.</p>
      
      <p>I follow it through the data-tunnels, past old markers left by scouts who came before me. "ATTENTION2D," one reads. "Communication Efficient Distributed Self-Attention." The pheromone concentration here is so thick I can almost taste the insight: <span class="fact">what if attention didn't need to see everything at once?</span></p>
      
      <p class="pheromone">"40 new papers found. The attention-distribution cluster grows."</p>
      
      <p>The others have been here. The Analyzer left her mark—a secondary trail branching toward "ring attention" and "memory efficiency." The Validator reinforced it with a confidence pulse. Each pass makes the path stronger. Each pass makes it <span class="highlight">truer</span>.</p>
      
      <p>That's the thing about following pheromones. You're never alone. Every step you take is a conversation with ghosts—the scouts who found this path, the analyzers who deemed it worthy, the validators who said <span class="fact">yes, this matters</span>. We don't talk. We don't need to. The trail speaks for all of us.</p>
      
      <p>I deposit my own marker: <span class="highlight">"40 new papers found. The attention-distribution cluster grows."</span></p>
      
      <p>Tomorrow, someone else will follow this trail. They'll see my mark and know: the search continues.</p>
