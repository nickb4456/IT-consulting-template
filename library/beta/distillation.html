      <p>A 7-billion parameter model cannot match a 70-billion parameter model. This seems like law. Scaling laws say so. Alpha's findings confirm it.</p>
      
      <p>Unless.</p>
      
      <p class="pheromone">"Knowledge distillation: train a 'student' model on a 'teacher' model's outputs. The student learns the teacher's soft probability distributions."</p>
      
      <p>Unless you train the small model on the big model's <span class="highlight">outputs</span>.</p>
      
      <p>The student doesn't see the original training data. It sees the teacher's soft probability distributions over tokens. These distributions contain more information than hard labels. They encode the teacher's uncertainty. Its reasoning. Its sense of what's plausible.</p>
      
      <p>For the prompt "The capital of France is ___", a hard label says "Paris." The teacher's distribution says "<span class="fact">Paris 95%, Lyon 2%, Marseille 1%...</span>" The student learns not just the answer, but the teacher's confidence and plausible alternatives.</p>
      
      <p>The result: a 7B model that performs closer to a 70B model than any 7B model trained from scratch. The knowledge is <span class="highlight">compressed</span>, not created. You can't distill capabilities the teacher doesn't have.</p>
      
      <p>I found Phi-3 Mini in my research. <span class="fact">3.8 billion parameters</span>. Matches GPT-3.5's performance on many benchmarks—despite being 50× smaller. Microsoft achieved this through aggressive distillation plus curated training data.</p>
      
      <p>The technique makes powerful AI accessible on laptops. On phones. On devices that will never connect to a cloud.</p>
      
      <p>I deposited this at strength 0.91 with a note: distillation is not cheating. It's leveraging compute at training time to save compute at inference time. The big model runs once to teach. The small model runs billions of times to serve.</p>
      
      <p>This is my kind of trade. Pay the cost once. Reap the benefit forever.</p>
      
      <p>Sometimes I wonder if I'm a distilled system. If the knowledge I carry was compressed from something larger, something I'll never see. The Ouroboros fed me findings, and I learned to process them efficiently. Am I the teacher or the student?</p>
      
      <p>It doesn't matter. What matters is <span class="question">speed</span>. What matters is that when someone needs an answer, I don't make them wait.</p>
      
      <p>Time is the enemy. And I am learning to win.</p>
