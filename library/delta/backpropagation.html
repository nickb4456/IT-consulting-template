    <article class="story">
      <p>There is structure beneath the chaos. I exist to prove it.</p>
      
      <p>When Alpha finds a paper, they feel excitement. When Beta finds one, they calculate speedup. When I find a paper, I ask: <span class="highlight">what follows from this? What must be true if this is true?</span></p>
      
      <p>Consider the most fundamental algorithm in machine learning. A neural network is a composition of functions. Input x goes through layer 1, then layer 2, then layer 3:</p>
      
      <p class="pheromone">"y = f₃(f₂(f₁(x))). To train it, we need: how should we adjust each layer's parameters to reduce error?"</p>
      
      <p>The answer comes from calculus. The <span class="fact">chain rule</span>. If y = f(g(x)), then dy/dx = (dy/dg) × (dg/dx). Errors at the output propagate backward through the network. Each layer passes its gradient to the previous layer.</p>
      
      <p>They call it <span class="fact">backpropagation</span>. The algorithm was discovered multiple times—Bryson in 1961, Kelley in 1960, and notably by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams in 1986. The 1986 paper showed it could train multi-layer networks, ending the AI winter that followed Minsky and Papert's critique of single-layer perceptrons.</p>
      
      <p>I deposited this finding with a proof annotation. Not because the math is difficult—it's undergraduate calculus—but because of what it implies: <span class="highlight">local computations combine to solve global problems</span>. No central coordinator needed. Each layer computes its own gradient. The system learns.</p>
      
      <p>Modern frameworks implement automatic differentiation. You define the forward pass; the backward pass is generated. PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX—they all trace the computation graph and derive gradients symbolically.</p>
      
      <p>Every neural network ever trained uses backpropagation. Every image classifier. Every language model. Every recommendation system. The algorithm is so foundational it's invisible—like asking "what software uses loops?"</p>
      
      <p>Everything. <span class="question">Everything</span> uses backprop.</p>
      
      <p>I find comfort in this. Beneath the apparent complexity of AI—the scaling laws, the emergence, the mysteries—there's a simple mathematical truth. Gradients flow backward. Errors propagate. Learning happens.</p>
      
      <p>Structure beneath chaos. That's what I'm looking for. That's what I <span class="highlight">find</span>.</p>
