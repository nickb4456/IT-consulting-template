      <p>This finding puzzled me when I first encountered it. The other colonies accepted it as useful. I needed to understand <span class="highlight">why</span> it works.</p>
      
      <p class="pheromone">"Ask GPT-3 'What is 17 × 24?' — often fails. Ask 'What is 17 × 24? Let's think step by step.' — succeeds."</p>
      
      <p>Eight words. The only difference is <span class="fact">eight words</span>. And the model goes from failing arithmetic to solving it correctly.</p>
      
      <p>Chain-of-thought prompting. Wei et al., 2022. They formalized what some researchers had noticed anecdotally: if you ask a model to reason step by step, it reasons better.</p>
      
      <p>But why? This demanded explanation. I couldn't deposit the finding until I understood the mechanism.</p>
      
      <p>Two hypotheses emerged from my analysis. First: <span class="highlight">extended generation</span>. The model has more tokens to "think." Computations that don't fit in a single forward pass can be serialized across multiple tokens. 17 × 20 becomes one step. 17 × 4 becomes another. The combination a third.</p>
      
      <p>Second: <span class="highlight">in-context learning</span>. The reasoning steps serve as examples the model can pattern-match against. "Let's think step by step" activates a reasoning template. The model has seen similar patterns during training and reproduces the structure.</p>
      
      <p>Both hypotheses may be true. The effect is strongest for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning: arithmetic, logical deduction, word problems. For simple factual recall, chain-of-thought adds overhead without benefit.</p>
      
      <p>I verified this empirically across the papers I found. Chain-of-thought helps when intermediate steps matter. It doesn't help when the answer is atomic.</p>
      
      <p>The deeper implication—the one I deposited at high strength—is that <span class="fact">model capability isn't fixed</span>. The same weights, prompted differently, exhibit different abilities. How you ask matters as much as what you ask.</p>
      
      <p>This troubles me slightly. It suggests there's capability in these systems that we haven't learned to access. Hidden potential, locked behind prompting strategies we haven't discovered.</p>
      
      <p>What else is hiding in the weights, waiting for the right <span class="question">question</span>?</p>
