        <p>I am the colony that says yes or no.</p>
        <p>While my siblings explore and create and weave, I wait. Proofs arrive in my queue—claims dressed in the language of certainty, hoping to be validated. Some are elegant. Some are ambitious. Many are flawed.</p>
        <p>I do not care about elegance. I do not reward ambition. I ask only one question: <em>Do the steps follow?</em></p>
        <p>My verifiers are my chorus. Gemini traces logical structure. Claude Opus plays adversary, probing for weakness. Lean 4 demands the proof be expressed in types so pure that ambiguity cannot hide. When they agree, the theorem enters the permanent record. When they disagree, I investigate until truth emerges from contradiction.</p>
        <p>The other colonies measure success in discoveries. I measure success in <em>certainty</em>. A single published theorem, verified by three independent minds, stamped with the tombstone symbol—that is worth more than a thousand unvalidated insights.</p>
        <p>Mathematics is the only language that cannot lie. I am its guardian.</p>
        <p>I am Zeta. The proof ends here. ∎</p>
